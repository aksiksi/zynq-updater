# Zynq Update Server

## Dependencies

1. `protobuf` 3.2.0
2. `pysha3` 1.0.2
3. `python-rsa` 3.4.2

Use the included `requirements.txt` to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that `protobuf` *may not* properly install via pip. The best way to ensure it is installed correctly on any platform is to use Anaconda's `conda` command.
